# fleet-recipes

A community-maintained repo of AutoPkg recipes for uploading macOS installer packages to Fleet. Contributions are welcome!

## Getting started

Run `autopkg repo-add fleet-recipes` to add this repo.

> **New to AutoPkg with Fleet?** See Fleet's official guide [Using AutoPkg with Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/guides/autopkg-with-fleet) for an end-to-end walkthrough of the workflow these recipes are built around.

### Recipe Dependencies

Fleet recipes depend on parent recipes from other AutoPkg repositories. See [PARENT_RECIPE_DEPENDENCIES.md](PARENT_RECIPE_DEPENDENCIES.md) for the complete list of required repositories and setup instructions.

## Overview

FleetImporter extends AutoPkg to integrate with Fleet's software management. Recipes use a **combined format** that supports both deployment modes in a single file:

- **[Direct mode](#direct-mode)**: Upload packages directly to Fleet via API
- **[GitOps mode](#gitops-mode)**: Upload to S3/CloudFront or Google Cloud Storage signed URLs and create pull requests for Git-based configuration management

Mode is controlled by the `GITOPS_MODE` input variable (default: `false`). Users can switch modes via recipe overrides without maintaining separate recipe files.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.9+**: Required by FleetImporter processor
- **AutoPkg 2.3+**: Required for recipe execution
- **boto3 1.18.0+**: Required for GitOps mode S3 operations (optional for direct mode)
  - Must be installed manually into AutoPkg's Python environment:
    ```bash
    /Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install boto3>=1.18.0
    ```
- **google-cloud-storage**: Required for GitOps mode GCS signed URL operations (optional for direct mode and S3 GitOps mode)
  - Must be installed manually into AutoPkg's Python environment:
    ```bash
    /Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install google-cloud-storage
    ```
  - Direct mode uses only native Python libraries (no external dependencies)

## Direct mode

Upload packages directly to your Fleet server. This is the **default mode** for all recipes.

### Running recipes in direct mode

```bash
# Set required configuration
defaults write com.github.autopkg FLEET_API_BASE "https://fleet.example.com"
defaults write com.github.autopkg FLEET_API_TOKEN "your-fleet-api-token"
defaults write com.github.autopkg FLEET_TEAM_ID "1"

# Run any recipe (defaults to direct mode)
autopkg run VendorName/SoftwareName.fleet.recipe.yaml
```

---

## GitOps mode

Upload packages to S3/CloudFront or Google Cloud Storage and create GitOps pull requests for Fleet configuration management.

> **Note:** GitOps mode requires you to provide your own package hosting backend. S3 mode uses S3 plus CloudFront. GCS mode writes a V4 signed URL into the package YAML, and those URLs can be valid for at most 7 days. When Fleet operates in GitOps mode, it deletes any packages not defined in the YAML files during sync ([fleetdm/fleet#34137](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/34137)). By hosting packages externally and using pull requests, you can stage updates and merge them at your own pace.

### Switching to GitOps mode

**Prerequisites:**
1. Install the package storage dependency into AutoPkg's Python environment:
   ```bash
   # S3/CloudFront backend
   /Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install boto3>=1.18.0

   # GCS signed URL backend
   /Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install google-cloud-storage
   ```

2. Create a recipe override and set `GITOPS_MODE: true`:
   ```bash
   # Create an override
   autopkg make-override VendorName/SoftwareName.fleet.recipe.yaml

   # Edit the override to set GITOPS_MODE: true
   # Then run it
   autopkg run SoftwareName.fleet.recipe.yaml
   ```

### Required infrastructure

- S3 backend: AWS S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, and AWS credentials with read/write access to the S3 bucket
- GCS backend: GCS bucket and Google credentials that can upload objects, read objects, and sign URLs

### Required configuration

Set S3/CloudFront configuration via AutoPkg preferences:

```bash
defaults write com.github.autopkg GITOPS_STORAGE_PROVIDER "s3"
defaults write com.github.autopkg AWS_S3_BUCKET "my-fleet-packages"
defaults write com.github.autopkg AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN "cdn.example.com"
defaults write com.github.autopkg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID "your-access-key"
defaults write com.github.autopkg AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "your-secret-key"
defaults write com.github.autopkg AWS_DEFAULT_REGION "us-east-1"
defaults write com.github.autopkg FLEET_GITOPS_REPO_URL "https://github.com/org/fleet-gitops.git"
defaults write com.github.autopkg FLEET_GITOPS_GITHUB_TOKEN "your-github-token"
```

Set GCS signed URL configuration via AutoPkg preferences:

```bash
defaults write com.github.autopkg GITOPS_STORAGE_PROVIDER "gcs"
defaults write com.github.autopkg GCP_STORAGE_BUCKET "my-fleet-packages"
defaults write com.github.autopkg GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON "/path/to/service-account.json"
defaults write com.github.autopkg GCP_SIGNED_URL_EXPIRATION "604800"
defaults write com.github.autopkg FLEET_GITOPS_REPO_URL "https://github.com/org/fleet-gitops.git"
defaults write com.github.autopkg FLEET_GITOPS_GITHUB_TOKEN "your-github-token"
```

`GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON` can be either the JSON key content itself or a path to a JSON key file. For local AutoPkg runs, a path is usually easier to manage. For CI, storing the JSON content directly in the variable may be simpler.

### GitHub token permissions

`FLEET_GITOPS_GITHUB_TOKEN` must be able to create branches, push commits, and open pull requests in your GitOps repository.

- **Fine-grained personal access token (recommended):**
  - Repository access: select your GitOps repository
  - Repository permissions:
    - **Contents: Read and write**
    - **Pull requests: Read and write**
- **Classic personal access token:**
  - **`repo`** scope (for private repositories)
  - **`public_repo`** scope can be used if the GitOps repository is public

### GitOps workflow

1. Package is uploaded to the configured storage backend
2. Package URL is generated (CloudFront URL for S3, signed URL for GCS)
3. Software YAML is created in the GitOps repo, along with any companion files it references (scripts/queries in `FLEET_GITOPS_SCRIPTS_DIR`, icon in `FLEET_GITOPS_ICONS_DIR`, auto-update policy in `FLEET_GITOPS_POLICIES_DIR`)
4. Pull request is opened for review

## Automatic icon extraction

FleetImporter automatically extracts and uploads application icons from `.pkg` files without requiring manual icon files:

- **Automatic extraction**: Finds the `.app` bundle in the package, extracts the icon from `Info.plist`, and converts it to PNG format
- **Size optimization**: Automatically compresses icons that exceed Fleet's 100 KB limit by resizing to 512px, 256px, or 128px
- **Format conversion**: Converts macOS `.icns` files to PNG format using the built-in `sips` tool
- **Fallback**: If extraction fails, continues without an icon (or uses manual `icon` path if provided)
- **Override**: Specify `icon: path/to/icon.png` in your recipe to use a custom icon instead of auto-extraction

---

## Custom scripts

FleetImporter supports custom install, uninstall, and post-install scripts. Scripts can be provided as **inline content** or as **file paths**.

### Inline scripts

Provide the script content directly in the recipe:

```yaml
Input:
  UNINSTALL_SCRIPT: |
    #!/bin/bash
    rm -rf "/Applications/MyApp.app"
    rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/MyApp"
```

### Script files

Reference a script file stored alongside the recipe:

```yaml
Input:
  UNINSTALL_SCRIPT: uninstall-myapp.sh
```

FleetImporter distinguishes a path from inline content automatically: a value containing a newline or starting with a `#!` shebang is treated as an inline script body, while a single-line value is treated as a path and its file is read (relative paths resolve against the recipe directory). A single-line value ending in `.sh`, `.ps1`, or `.sql` that doesn't exist on disk is reported as a missing file. This means inline scripts that contain slashes (e.g. `/usr/sbin/chown`) are no longer mistaken for paths.

**Benefits of script files:**
- Keeps recipes clean and readable
- Makes scripts easier to maintain and test independently
- Supports syntax highlighting in editors
- Enables script reuse across multiple recipes

### Using scripts with overrides

When creating AutoPkg overrides with `autopkg make-override`, script file references continue to work because:

1. **Script files stay with the original recipe** - The override only changes Input values, not companion files
2. **Paths resolve to the original recipe directory** - AutoPkg's `RECIPE_DIR` always points to the original recipe location
3. **You can override with custom scripts** by:
   - Providing inline script content in your override
   - Specifying an absolute path to your own script file
   - Copying the script to your override directory and using a relative path

**Example override customization:**

```yaml
Input:
  # Option 1: Use inline script
  UNINSTALL_SCRIPT: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Custom uninstall logic"
  
  # Option 2: Use absolute path to custom script
  UNINSTALL_SCRIPT: /path/to/my-custom-uninstall.sh
  
  # Option 3: Default - uses original recipe's script file
  UNINSTALL_SCRIPT: uninstall-myapp.sh
```

### Supported script parameters

All three script parameters support both inline and file path modes:

- `install_script`: Custom installation script
- `uninstall_script`: Custom uninstall script
- `post_install_script`: Script to run after installation

The `pre_install_query` parameter (osquery condition) is resolved the same way — provide the query inline or as a path to a file.

### How scripts are delivered

Regardless of how you provide a script, FleetImporter always resolves it to its content first, then delivers it according to the mode:

- **Direct mode**: the script content is uploaded inline to Fleet's API.
- **GitOps mode**: the content is written to a file in `FLEET_GITOPS_SCRIPTS_DIR` (default `platforms/macos/scripts`, e.g. `myapp-postinstall.sh`) and the package YAML references it by relative path. Fleet's GitOps spec requires `install_script.path` / `post_install_script.path` / etc. to point to a file in the repo, so inline content is never embedded directly into the package YAML.

## Auto-update policy automation

FleetImporter can automatically create Fleet policies that detect outdated software versions and trigger automatic updates via policy automation. When enabled, a policy is created for each software package that:

1. **Detects outdated versions**: Uses osquery to find hosts running any version except the latest
2. **Triggers installation**: Automatically installs the updated package when policy fails

### Enabling auto-update policies

Auto-update policies are **disabled by default** for backward compatibility. Enable them via recipe overrides:

```bash
# Enable in a recipe override (per-recipe control)
autopkg make-override VendorName/SoftwareName.fleet.recipe.yaml
# Edit the override to set automatic_update: true
autopkg run SoftwareName.fleet.recipe.yaml
```

### How it works

When `automatic_update` is set to `true`, FleetImporter:

1. **Builds version query**: Creates an osquery SQL query to detect outdated versions using one of two modes:

   **Automatic Bundle ID Mode** (Recommended):
   If no custom query is provided, the processor automatically:
   - Extracts the bundle identifier from the `.pkg` file
   - Generates a default query using the `apps` table with `!=` comparison
   - Works for most standard macOS applications
   - Requires no manual configuration

   **Custom Query Mode** (Advanced use cases):
   Define `auto_update_policy_query` in your recipe with a `%VERSION%` placeholder:
   ```yaml
   auto_update_policy_query: |
     SELECT 1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM apps WHERE bundle_identifier = 'com.github.GitHubClient' AND bundle_short_version != '%VERSION%'
     );
   ```
   The `%VERSION%` placeholder is replaced with the actual version at runtime. Use custom queries for:
   - Non-standard bundle ID detection
   - Windows registry-based detection
   - Linux package managers
   - Custom osquery tables or complex version logic

2. **Creates policy** (Direct mode): Uses Fleet API to create or update a policy with:
   - Descriptive name (e.g., `autopkg-auto-update-github-desktop`)
   - Version detection query (custom or auto-generated)
   - Link to install package automatically on policy failure
   - Platform targeting (macOS only)

3. **Creates policy YAML** (GitOps mode): Writes a policy definition to `platforms/macos/policies/` (as a list, per Fleet's GitOps schema), references the package by its `hash_sha256` in `install_software`, and wires a `path:` reference to the policy into the same team YAML that defines the package (required for Fleet to honor the `install_software` automation)

### Policy naming

Policy names are generated from the `AUTO_UPDATE_POLICY_NAME` template:

- **Default template**: `autopkg-auto-update-%NAME%`
- **%NAME% placeholder**: Replaced with slugified software title
- **Slugification**: Converts to lowercase, removes special characters, replaces spaces with hyphens
- **Customization**: Override `AUTO_UPDATE_POLICY_NAME` in your recipe to use a different naming pattern

Examples:
- `GitHub Desktop` → `autopkg-auto-update-github-desktop`
- `Visual Studio Code` → `autopkg-auto-update-visual-studio-code`
- `1Password 8` → `autopkg-auto-update-1password-8`

### SQL injection prevention

All bundle identifiers and versions are automatically escaped to prevent SQL injection:

- Single quotes are doubled: `com.o'reilly.app` → `com.o''reilly.app`
- Query remains safe even with malicious input
- Tested against common injection patterns (OR clauses, UNION, DROP TABLE, etc.)

### Important considerations

1. **Query modes**: 
   - **Custom queries** (via `auto_update_policy_query`) give full control and support any osquery table
   - **Automatic mode** extracts CFBundleIdentifier from `.pkg` files and works for standard macOS apps
   - If automatic extraction fails and no custom query is provided, policy creation is skipped with a warning

2. **Version comparison**: Uses exact version matching with `!=` comparison. Policies pass when no apps exist with incorrect versions (app not installed OR all instances have correct version). Policies fail when any app instance has a version that doesn't match the required version.

3. **Policy cleanup**: Policies are NOT automatically deleted when software is removed. You should manually delete outdated policies or implement cleanup automation.

4. **Error handling**: Policy creation failures are logged as warnings and don't block package uploads. Check AutoPkg output for any policy-related errors.

5. **Team vs global policies**:
   - Direct mode: Creates team-specific policies when `FLEET_TEAM_ID` > 0, global policies when `FLEET_TEAM_ID` = 0
   - GitOps mode: Policy scope determined by GitOps repository structure

6. **Idempotency**: Existing policies with the same name are updated (not duplicated) when recipes run again
